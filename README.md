> Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the goal is to clear a minefield without detonating any mines. The game is played on a grid of squares, some of which contain mines.

## Features

- Customizable game board size
- Randomized mine placement for each game
- Flagging system to mark potential mines

## How to Play

1. The game begins with a grid of squar
es, some of which contain mines.
2. The player must left-click on a square to reveal what's underneath. If the square contains a mine, the game is over.
3. If the square does not contain a mine, a number is revealed indicating how many mines are in the adjacent squares.
4. Using the numbers as clues, the player must deduce which squares contain mines and flag them using the right-click button.
5. The game is won when all non-mine squares have been revealed, and lost when a mine is detonated.
